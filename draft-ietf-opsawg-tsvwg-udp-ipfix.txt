1.  Introduction

   IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) [RFC7011] is a protocol that is
   widely deployed in networks for traffic management purposes
   (Section 2 of [RFC6632]).  The protocol specifies the encoding of a
   set of basic data types and how the various Information Elements
   (IEs) are transmitted.  In order to support the export of new flow-
   related measurement data, new IEs can be defined and registered in a
   dedicated IANA registry [IANA-IPFIX] for interoperability.

   This document specifies new IPFIX Information Elements for UDP
   options (Section 4).  A brief overview of UDP options is provided in
   Section 3.

   The IE specified in Section 4.1 uses the new abstract data type
   ("unsigned256") defined in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ipfix-tcpo-v6eh].

   Transport (including MTU) considerations are discussed in Section 10
   of [RFC7011].

   Examples to illustrate the use of the new IPFIX Information Elements
   are provided in Section 5.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the IPFIX-specific terminology (e.g., Flow)
   defined in Section 2 of [RFC7011].  As in the base IPFIX
   specification [RFC7011], these IPFIX-specific terms have the first
   letter of a word capitalized.

   The document adheres to the naming conventions for Information
   Elements per Section 2.3 of [RFC7012].

   Also, this document uses the terms defined in Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options], especially "datagram" and "surplus
   area".

3.  UDP Options at a Glance

   UDP [RFC0768] does not support an extension mechanism similar to the
   options supported by other transport protocols, such as TCP
   [RFC9293], SCTP [RFC9260], or DCCP [RFC4340].  Such a mechanism can
   be useful for various applications, e.g., to discover a path MTU or
   share timestamps.  To fill that void, [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options]
   extends UDP with a mechanism to insert extensions in datagrams.  To
   do so, and unlike the conventional approach that relies upon
   transport headers, [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options] uses trailers.
   Concretely, UDP options are placed in the surplus area (that is, the
   area of an IP payload that follows a UDP packet).  See Figure 1.  An
   example of the use of UDP options for Datagram Packetization Layer
   Path Maximum Transmission Unit Discovery (DPLPMTUD) is described in
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options-dplpmtud].

   Sections 4.1 and 4.2 introduce new IEs to export the observed UDP
   options.

   UDP options are unambiguously identified by means of a 1-byte field,
   called "Kind".

   Options indicated by Kind values in the range 0-191 are called SAFE
   options.  Such options can be silently ignored by legacy receivers
   because they do not alter the UDP user data (Section 11 of
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options]).  SAFE options are exported using the
   IE defined in Section 4.1.

   Options indicated by Kind values in the range 192-255 are called
   UNSAFE options.  Such options are not safe for legacy receivers to
   ignore because they alter the UDP user data (Section 12 of
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options]).  UNSAFE options are exported using the
   IE defined in Section 4.2.

   UDP options occur per-packet within a Flow and can be inserted at any
   time in the Flow.

   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options] reserves two options for experiments:
   the Experimental option (EXP, Kind=127) for SAFE options and the
   UNSAFE Experimental option (UEXP, Kind=254).  For both options,
   Experiment Identifiers (ExIDs) are used to differentiate concurrent
   use of these options.  Known ExIDs are expected to be registered
   within IANA.  Section 4.4 specifies a new IPFIX IE to export observed
   ExIDs in the EXP options.  Also, Section 4.5 specifies a new IPFIX IE
   to export observed ExIDs in the UEXP options.  Only 16-bit ExIDs are
   supported in [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options].

   This document does not intend to elaborate operational guidance/
   implications of UDP options.  The document focuses exclusively on
   exporting observed UDP options in datagrams.

4.  New UDP IPFIX Information Elements

      RFC Editor Note: Please update "URL_IANA_UDP_OPTIONS" reference
      with the URL of the "UDP Option Kind Numbers" registry group and
      "URL_IANA_UDP_ExIDs" with the URL of the "UDP Experimental Option
      Experiment Identifiers (UDP ExIDs)" registry that will be created
      by IANA as per Section 25 of [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options].

   Given the Kind structure of SAFE and UNSAFE UDP options, using one
   single IE that would multiplex both types of option will limit the
   benefits of reduced-size encoding in the presence of UNSAFE options.
   For example, at least 24 octets would be needed to report mandatory
   SAFE options that are observed in a Flow.  In order to use less bits
   to report observed UDP options, distinct IEs are thus defined to
   report SAFE (Section 4.1) and UNSAFE (Section 4.2) UDP options.  As
   further detailed in Section 5.1, only one octet is needed to report
   mandatory SAFE options.

4.1.  udpSafeOptions

   Name:  udpSafeOptions

   ElementID:  TBD1

   Description:  Observed SAFE UDP options in a Flow.  The information
      is encoded in a set of bit fields.

      Options are mapped to bits according to their option numbers.  UDP
      option Kind 0 corresponds to the least-significant bit in the
      udpSafeOptions IE while Kind 191 corresponds to the 65th most-
      significant bit of the IE.  The bit is set to 1 if the
      corresponding SAFE UDP option is observed at least once in the
      Flow.  The bit is set to 0 if the option is never observed in the
      Flow.  The 64 most-significant bits MUST be set to 0.

      The reduced-size encoding per Section 6.2 of [RFC7011] is followed
      whenever fewer octets are needed to report observed SAFE UDP
      options.  For example, if only option Kinds <= 31 are observed,
      then the value of the udpSafeOptions IE can be encoded as
      unsigned32, or if only option Kinds <= 63 are observed, then the
      value of the udpSafeOptions IE can be encoded as unsigned64.

      The presence of udpSafeExIDList is an indication that the SAFE
      Experimental option is observed in a Flow.  The presence of
      udpSafeExIDList takes precedence over setting the corresponding
      bit in the udpSafeOptions IE for the same Flow.  In order to
      optimize the use of the reduced-size encoding in the presence of
      udpSafeExIDList IE, the Exporter MUST NOT set to 1 the EXP flag of
      the udpSafeOptions IE that is reported for the same Flow.

      options.

4.2.  udpUnsafeOptions

   Name:  udpUnsafeOptions

   ElementID:  TBD2

   Description:  Observed UNSAFE UDP options in a Flow.  The information
      is encoded in a set of bit fields.

      Options are mapped to bits according to their option numbers.  UDP
      option Kind 192 corresponds to the least-significant bit in the
      udpUnsafeOptions IE while Kind 255 corresponds to the most-
      significant bit of the IE.  The bit is set to 1 if the
      corresponding UNSAFE UDP option is observed at least once in the
      Flow.  The bit is set to 0 if the option is never observed in the
      Flow.

      The reduced-size encoding per Section 6.2 of [RFC7011] is followed
      whenever fewer octets are needed to report observed UNSAFE UDP
      options.

      The presence of udpUnsafeExIDList is an indication that the UNSAFE
      Experimental option is observed in a Flow.  The presence of
      udpUnsafeExIDList takes precedence over setting the corresponding
      bit in the udpUnsafeOptions IE for the same Flow.  In order to
      optimize the use of the reduced-size encoding in the presence of
      udpUnsafeExIDList IE, the Exporter MUST NOT set to 1 the UEXP flag
      of the udpUnsafeOptions IE that is reported for the same Flow.

   Abstract Data Type:  unsigned64

   Data Type Semantics:  flags

   Additional Information:  See the "UDP Option Kind Numbers" registry
      at [URL_IANA_UDP_OPTIONS].

      options.

4.3.  udpExID

   Name:  udpExID

   ElementID:  TBD3

   Description:  Observed ExID in an Experimental option (EXP, Kind=127)
      or an UNSAFE Experimental option (UEXP, Kind=254).

      A basicList of udpExID is used to report udpSafeExIDList and
      udpUnsafeExIDList values.

   Abstract Data Type:  unsigned16

   Data Type Semantics:  identifier

   Additional Information:  See the "UDP Experimental Option Experiment
      Identifiers (UDP ExIDs)" registry at [URL_IANA_UDP_ExIDs].

   ElementID:  TBD4

   Description:  Observed ExIDs in the Experimental option (EXP,
      Kind=127).

      A basicList of udpExID Information Elements in which each udpExID
      Information Element carries the ExID observed in an EXP option.

5.  Examples

5.1.  Reduced-size Encoding

   Given the UDP Kind allocation in Section 10 of
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options] and the option mapping defined in
   Section 4.1 of this document, fewer octets are likely to be used for
   Flows with mandatory UDP options.

   Figure 2 shows an example of the Kind/bit mappings in the
   udpSafeOptions IE for a Flow in which End of Options List (EOL,
   Kind=0) and Alternate payload checksum (APC, Kind=2) options are
   observed.  Only the bits that corresponds to EOL and APC options are
   set to 1.

                            1                          25
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-++-++-+-+-+-+...+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     Figure 2: An Example of udpSafeOptions IE with EOL and APC Options

   One octet is sufficient to report these observed options because the
   leading zeros are dropped per the reduced-size encoding guidance.
   Concretely, the reported udpSafeOptions IE will be set to 0x05
   (Figure 3).

                             MSB           LSB

                              and APC Options

5.2.  SAFE Experimental Option

   Let us now consider a UDP Flow in which SAFE Experimental options are
   observed.  If a udpSafeOptions IE is exported for this Flow, then
   that IE will have the EXP bit set to 1 (Figure 4).  This example does
   not make any assumption about the presence of other UDP options ("X"
   can be set to 0 or 1).

        MSB                                                     LSB

5.3.  ExIDs and Reduced-size Encoding

   Now assume that EOL, APC, EXP, and UEXP options are observed in a
   Flow.  Let us also consider that the observed SAFE Experimental
   options have ExIDs set to 0x9858 and 0xE2D4, and UNSAFE Experimental
   options have ExIDs set to 0xC3D9 and 0x1234.  Figure 5 shows an
   excerpt of the Data Set encoding with a focus on SAFE Experimental
   options have ExIDs.  The meaning of the fields is defined in
   [RFC6313].

      MSB                                                          LSB

           Figure 5: Example of UDP Experimental Option ExID IEs

   Following the guidance in Section 4.1, the reported udpSafeOptions IE
   will be set to 0x05 even in the presence of EXP options.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce new security considerations other
   than those already discussed in Section 11 of [RFC7011] and Section 8
   of [RFC7012].

      Note to IANA:  The "Specification" column points to the section
         with the required information to register each IE.

      Note to the RFC Editor:  Please remove the IANA note once IANA
         actions are implemented.
