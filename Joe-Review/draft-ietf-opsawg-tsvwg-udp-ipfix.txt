1.  Introduction

   IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) [RFC7011] is a protocol that is
   widely deployed in operators networks for traffic management purposes
   (Section 2 of [RFC6632]).  The protocol specifies the encoding of a
   set of basic data types and how the various Information Elements
   (IEs) are transmitted.  In order to support the export of new flow-
   related measurement data, new IEs can be defined and registered in a
   dedicated IANA registry [IANA-IPFIX] for interoperability.

   This document specifies new IPFIX Information Elements for UDP
   options (Section 4).  A brief overview of UDP options is provided in
   Section 3.

   The IE specified in Section 4.1 uses the new abstract data type
   defined in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-ipfix-tcpo-v6eh].

   Examples to illustrate the use of the new IPFIX Information Elements
   are provided in Section 6.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   This document uses the IPFIX-specific terminology (e.g., Flow)
   defined in Section 2 of [RFC7011].  As in [RFC7011], these IPFIX-
   specific terms have the first letter of a word capitalized.

   The document adheres to the naming conventions for Information
   Elements per Section 2.3 of [RFC7012].

   Also, this document uses the terms defined in Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options], especially "datagram" and "surplus
   area".

3.  UDP Options at a Glance

   UDP [RFC0768] does not support an extension mechanism similar to the
   options supported by other transport protocols, such as TCP
   [RFC9293], SCTP [RFC9260], or DCCP [RFC4340].  Such a mechanism can
   be useful for various applications, e.g., to discover a path MTU or
   share timestamps.  To fill that void, [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options]
   extends UDP with a mechanism to insert extensions in datagrams.  To
   do so, and unlike the conventional approach that relies upon
   transport headers, [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options] uses trailers.
   Concretely, UDP options are placed in the surplus area (that is, the
   area of an IP payload that follows a UDP packet).  See Figure 1.  An
   example of the use of UDP options is described in
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options-dplpmtud].

                             IP transport payload
                <------------------------------------------------->
      +--------+---------+----------------------+------------------+
      | IP Hdr | UDP Hdr |     UDP user data    |   surplus area   |

                           Figure 1: Surplus Area

   Sections 4.1 and 4.2 introduce new IEs to export the observed UDP
   options.

   Options indicated by Kind values in the range 0-191 are called SAFE
   options.  Such options can be silently ignored by legacy receivers
   because they do not alter the UDP user data (Section 11 of
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options]).  Safe options are exported using the
   IE defined in Section 4.1.

   Options indicated by Kind values in the range 192-255 are called
   UNSAFE options.  Such options are not safe for legacy receivers to
   ignore because they alter the UDP user data (Section 12 of
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options]).  Unsafe options are exported using the
   IE defined in Section 4.2.

   UDP options occur per-packet within a Flow and can be inserted at any
   time in the Flow.

   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options] reserves two options for experiments:
   the Experimental option (EXP, Kind=127) for SAFE options and the
   UNSAFE Experimental option (UEXP, Kind=254).  For both options,
   Experimental ID (ExIDs) are used to differentiate concurrent use of
   these options.  Known ExIDs are expected to be registered within
   IANA.  Section 4.3 specifies a new IPFIX IE to export observed ExIDs
   in the EXP options.  Also, Section 4.4 specifies a new IPFIX IE to
   export observed ExIDs in the UEXP options.  Only 16-bit ExIDs are
   supported in [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options].

   This document does not intend to elaborate operational guidance/
   implications of UDP options.  The document focuses exclusively on
   exporting observed UDP options in datagrams.

      RFC Editor Note: Please update "URL_IANA_UDP_OPTIONS" reference
      with the URL of the "UDP Option Kind Numbers" registry group and
      "URL_IANA_UDP_ExIDs" with the URL of the "UDP Experimental Option
      Experiment Identifiers (UDP ExIDs)" registry that will be created
      by IANA as per Section 25 of [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options].

4.1.  udpSafeOptions

   Name:  udpSafeOptions

   ElementID:  TBD1

   Description:  Observed safe UDP options in a Flow.  The information
      is encoded in a set of bit fields.

      Options are mapped to bits according to their option numbers.  UDP
      option Kind 0 corresponds to the least-significant bit in the
      udpSafeOptions IE, UDP option Kind 1 corresponds to the next bit,
      etc.  The bit is set to 1 if the corresponding safe UDP option is
      observed in the Flow.  The bit is set to 0 if the option is not
      observed in the Flow.

      The first 64 most-significant bits MUST be set to 0.  These
      leading zeroes will be dropped per the reduced-Size encoding.

   Abstract Data Type:  unsigned256

   Data Type Semantics:  flags

   Additional Information:  See the assigned UDP options in the "UDP
      Option Kind Numbers" registry at [URL_IANA_UDP_OPTIONS].

      See [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options] for more details about UDP
      options.

   Reference:  This-Document

4.2.  udpUnsafeOptions

   Name:  udpUnsafeOptions

   ElementID:  TBD2

   Description:  Observed unsafe UDP options in a Flow.  The information
      is encoded in a set of bit fields.

      Options are mapped to bits according to their option numbers.  UDP
      option Kind 192 corresponds to the least-significant bit in the
      udpOptions IE while Kind 255 corresponds to the most-significant
      bit of the IE.  The bit is set to 1 if the corresponding unsafe
      UDP option is observed in the Flow.  The bit is set to 0 if the
      option is not observed in the Flow.

   Abstract Data Type:  unsigned64

   Data Type Semantics:  flags

   Additional Information:  See the assigned UDP options in the "UDP
      Option Kind Numbers" registry at [URL_IANA_UDP_OPTIONS].

      See [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options] for more details about UDP
      options.

   Reference:  This-Document

4.3.  udpSafeExperimentalOptionExID

   Name:  udpSafeExperimentalOptionExID

   ElementID:  TBD3

   Description:  Observed Experiments ID (ExIDs) in the Experimental
      option (EXP, Kind=127).

      The information is encoded in a set of 16-bit fields.  Each 16-bit
      field carries the ExID observed in an EXP option.

   Abstract Data Type:  octetArray

   Data Type Semantics:  identifier

   Additional Information:  See the assignments in the "UDP Experimental
      Option Experiment Identifiers (UDP ExIDs)" registry at
      [URL_IANA_UDP_ExIDs].

      See [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options] for more details about ExIDs.

   Reference:  This-Document

4.4.  udpUnsafeExperimentalOptionExID

   Name:  udpUnsafeExperimentalOptionExID

   ElementID:  TBD4

   Description:  Observed Experiments ID (ExIDs) in the UNSAFE
      Experimental option (UEXP, Kind=254).

      The information is encoded in a set of 16-bit fields.  Each 16-bit
      field carries the ExID observed in an UEXP option.

   Abstract Data Type:  octetArray

   Data Type Semantics:  identifier

   Additional Information:  See the assignments in the "UDP Experimental
      Option Experiment Identifiers (UDP ExIDs)" registry at
      [URL_IANA_UDP_ExIDs].

      See [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options] for more details about ExIDs.

   Reference:  This-Document

5.  Operational Considerations

   The reduced-size encoding specified in Section 6.2 of [RFC7011] is
   followed whenever fewer octets are needed to report observed safe and
   unsafe UDP options.  For example, if only option Kinds <= 32 are
   observed, then the value of udpSafeOptions can be encoded as
   unsigned32, or if only option Kinds <= 63 are observed, then the
   value can be encoded as unsigned64.

   The presence of udpSafeExperimentalOptionExID (or
   udpUnsafeExperimentalOptionExID) is an indication that the SAFE (or
   UNSAFE) Experimental option is observed in a Flow.  The presence of
   udpSafeExperimentalOptionExID (or udpUnsafeExperimentalOptionExID)
   takes precedence over setting the correspoding bits in the
   udpSafeOptions (or udpUnsafeOptions) IE for the same Flow.  In order
   to make use of the reduced-size encoding in the presence of
   udpSafeExperimentalOptionExID (or udpUnsafeExperimentalOptionExID)
   IE, the Exporter SHOULD NOT set to 1 the EXP (or UEXP) flags of the
   the udpSafeOptions (or udpUnsafeOptions) IE that is reported for the
   same Flow.

   Transport (including MTU) considerations are discussed in Section 10
   of [RFC7011].

6.  Examples

   Given UDP Kind allocation in Section 10 of
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options] and the option mapping defined in
   Section 4.1 of this document, fewer octets are likely to be used for
   Flows with mandatory UDP options.

   Figure 2 shows an example of reported values in a udpSafeOptions IE
   for a Flow in which End of Options List (EOL, Kind=0) and Alternate
   payload checksum (APC, Kind=2) options are observed.  One octet is
   sufficient to report these observed options.  Concretely, the
   reported udpOptions IE will be set to 0x05.

       MSB                                                     LSB
                            1                          25
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-++-++-+-+-+-+...+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

        Figure 2: An Example of udpOptions with EOL and APC Options

   Let us now consider a UDP Flow in which both SAFE and UNSAFE
   Experimental options are observed.  If a udpSafeOptions IE is
   exported for this Flow, then that IE will have the EXP bit set to 1
   (Figure 3).  This example does not make any assumption about the
   presence of other UDP options.

        MSB                                                     LSB

        +-+-+-+-+...+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-++-++-+-+-+-+...+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

           Figure 3: An Example of udpSafeOptions with EXP Option

   Now assume that EOL, APC, EXP, and UEXP options are observed for a
   Flow.  Let us also consider that the observed SAFE Experimental
   options have ExIDs set to 0x9858 and 0xE2D4, and UNSAFE Experimental
   options have ExIDs set to 0xC3D9 and 0x1234.  As shown in Figure 4,
   the following IEs are used to report observed ExIDs:

   1.  udpSafeExperimentalOptionExID IE set to 0x9858E2D4 to report
       observed ExIDs of SAFE Experimental options.

   2.  udpUnsafeExperimentalOptionExID IE set to 0xC3D91234 to report
       the ExIDs of the observed UNSAFE Experimental options.

     udpSafeExperimentalOptionExID IE:

     MSB                                                          LSB

              Figure 4: Example of UDP Experimental option IEs

   Following the guidance in Section 5, the udpSafeOptions IE will be
   set to 0x05 (i.e., set the EXP bit to 0).
