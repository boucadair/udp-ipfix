The definition of Flow in IPFIX is generic enough:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraffic Flow or Flow\r\n\r\n      There are several definitions of the term 'flow' being used by the\r\n      Internet community.  Within the context of IPFIX, we use the\r\n      following definition:\r\n\r\n      A Flow is defined as a set of packets or frames passing an\r\n      Observation Point in the network during a certain time interval.\r\n      All packets belonging to a particular Flow have a set of common\r\n      properties.  Each property is defined as the result of applying a\r\n      function to the values of:\r\n\r\n      1. one or more packet header fields (e.g., destination IP\r\n         address), transport header fields (e.g., destination port\r\n         number), or application header fields (e.g., RTP header fields\r\n         [[RFC3550](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3550)]).\r\n\r\n      2. one or more characteristics of the packet itself (e.g., number\r\n         of MPLS labels, etc.).\r\n\r\n      3. one or more of the fields derived from Packet Treatment (e.g.,\r\n         next-hop IP address, the output interface, etc.).\r\n\r\n      A packet is defined as belonging to a Flow if it completely\r\n      satisfies all the defined properties of the Flow.\r\n\r\n      Note that the set of packets represented by a Flow may be empty;\r\n      that is, a Flow may represent zero or more packets.  As sampling\r\n      is a Packet Treatment, this definition includes packets selected\r\n      by a sampling mechanism.\r\n```",
